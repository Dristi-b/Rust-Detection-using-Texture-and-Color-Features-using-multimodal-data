# Rust-Detection-using-Texture-and-Color-Features-using-multimodal-data
 The emergence of plant rust has proven to be a serious threat
 to agricultural yields. The identification of plant diseases is tradition
ally done through visual inspection that often lead to delays and sig
nificant amount of loss by the time diagnosis is made. On the other
 hand, advanced deep learning models perform well with accuracy but
 their large size of datasets and computational complexities make them
 unsuitable for deployment which limits their real time applications. This
 study focuses on a method to identify rust using both ground and aerial
 photographs of plants. It follows a sequence of steps, including pre
processing, extracting Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) color features,
 utilizing Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for extracting tex
ture features, combining these extracted features, and classifying the
 healthy and rust-affected crops. Machine learning based Random Forest
 (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
 models are used to achieve higher performance, resulting in greater ac
curacy in identifying rust pathogens. The performance of our model ex
ceeds existing approaches and is also the highest among feature-based
 methods, making it the most potential method for rust detection.
